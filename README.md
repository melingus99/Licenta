This is my undergraduate project, this is developed on top of pmariglia project (https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown). Check their project for more information on how the environment works, the requirements and the whole baseflow of the application.
My work is in the bots folder, particularly, the MinMax agent, RL agent and MCTS agent. Other changes are found in the battle_modifier.py so that the reward for the Q-learning agent can be written as accurately as possible.
I have also developed a GUI, it can be found in the View package and a controller in the Controller package.
To start the application run View/main_window.py
